Your CSE 599 Portfolios should consist of a Google Drive folder which you share
with me (jpolitz@eng.ucsd.edu) and Reshul Dani (rdani@eng.ucsd.edu).    In this
folder you will place the following documents (over the course of the quarter):

## TA role log (Google doc, updated weekly)

At the beginning of the quarter, you will use the ASES form to establish your
roles and responsibilities as a TA. Documenting and assessing your activities
as a TA will help you evaluate if you are spending your time and energy
effectively and in line with the expectations of your instructor. On a weekly
basis,

- **Record the number of hours** you spent total on your TA duties, and how those
  hours were divided across various tasks. Each TA job is different, so your
  hour allocation may be different from others. Typical activities include:
  discussion section, lab, assignment writeup preparation, assignment
  administration (grading scripts, turnin scripts), general admin / prep,
  Piazza Q&A, lecture attendance, office hours, etc.

- **Celebrate a (small) victory.** Find some aspect of your TA job that you did
  particular well or that worked particularly effectively this week. It's
  important to reaffirm why we do what we do, and to take time to make note of
  even small accomplishments. Did you see an idea "click" for a student after
  you worked with him/her? Did you collaborate with your fellow TAs to come up
  with well-motivated, well-structured examples for discussion section? Were
  you recognized by a student on campus? (Of course, these are just a few
  examples, your victory may be something completely different.)

- **Plan to refine and iterate.** What didn't work as well as you would have
  liked this week? What can you do next week (or next term? or next year?) to
  improve it? 

**Minimum passing threshold**: Each weekly entry must address all three
components outlined above. The reflections must start by week 2 and there can
be no more than a one-week gap between entries on your TA activities. For
example, reflections on your week 1, week 3, week 5, and week 7, and 9
activities would meet the minimum passing threshold.  But we expect you to
reflect most weeks.


## Teaching Reflections (Separate documents: PDF, Google doc, Text, or whatever)

Your portfolio must included a minimum of one reflection on your own teaching,
and one reflection on someone else's teaching.    The exception to this rule is
is that if you are not teaching a discussion section this quarter, you may
submit two reflections of someone else's teaching.  You are welcome to have
more.  

**Reflection on your own teaching based on external feedback**:  Have someone give
you feedback on your teaching.  Request that a mentor TA, the instructor for
your class, or Christine observe your discussion section (note: your instructor
should do this at least once during the quarter) and then meet with you to
provide feedback on what they observed.   There is a small budget where you can
treat your instructor/mentor to coffee for these meetings (no more than $10,
please).   If you choose to get your feedback while treating your mentor to
coffee, just submit your receipt to Prof. Alvarado and she will reimburse you
for it.  Then, after you have met and received your feedback, write a
reflection including the following:

- The date of the observation, the class, and the name of the observer

- Summarize the main strengths and weaknesses according to the person who
  observed.  If they provided you with written feedback, you can simply copy
  and paste these, with attribution.

- Write a paragraph or two reflecting on why you think you received the
  feedback you received (were you expecting it?  was anything a surprise?) and
  what might do differently to address the feedback.  

**Reflection on someone else's teaching**: Attend a class or discussion section
for a class that you are not currently taking.  Pay attention to how the
instructor/TA leads the class.  Record the class, the date and the instructor
in your reflection .  Then address any or all of the following questions in
your reflection: 


- What did the instructor do to engage students in learning?  How effecting were these techniques?
- How did the instructor use visual aids and board work in their explanation?  How effective were these?
- How clear were the instructor's technical explanations?   What made them clear or not clear?
- How did the instructor motivate or contextualize the course content?  How well did it work?
- How did the instructor handle student questions?  Was this effective?  Why or why not?
- Was there anything about the way the instructor taught that stood out to you?  What was it and why?
- Did the instructor make efforts to include all students in their class?  How effective were they?
- (Addressing any other aspects of the instruction that stood out to you is also great!)

## Micro-Teach Video and Reflection (week 2 assignment, reflection document with link to video)

The next piece you will include in your portfolio is your assignment from Week
2: Your micro-teach video and reflection.   

- First, record yourself teaching a technical concept. You may choose any
  concept you wish. Possible examples include (but are not limited to):
  deleting an element from a linked list, analyzing the Big-O running time of
  an algorithm, a sorting algorithm, event handling in Java, etc. Make sure
  your topic is small enough in scope that the explanation reasonably fits into
  3-4 minutes. The video must show your body and your voice should be clearly
  audible. You are expected to use a whiteboard or other visual aids as you
  would when explaining this concept in discussion section or office hours. The
  emphasis for this assignment is on basic skills:

- Board work: make sure to write clearly, large enough, use enough colors, and organize your drawing/writing appropriately
- Speaking skills: speak clearly, to the camera, use eye contact, state clearly what you are explaining

This video is a starting point that you will build from over the course of the
quarter, so don't go overboard making the video perfect. You should prepare,
and make sure that you know what you are going to say, but some mistakes and
stumbles are OK. Just do your best at this point. Also, if you prepared a
similar video as part of your TA application, feel free to use the same one or
some modification of it. 

Submit your video by placing it on YouTube or another file sharing service
(e.g. github). You should all have a YouTube account through your eng.ucsd.edu
account. You can make is a private video as long as you share it with me
(cjalvarado@eng.ucsd.edu) and our TA (rdani@eng.ucsd.edu). You may also choose
to make the video public. It's up to you. 

Next, the hard part. **Watch the video.** It's always uncomfortable to watch
yourself. But remember, everyone in the class will have to do the same thing.
Use the [Teaching Feedback
Form](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lO-zdS7y8PczGe9W8ohqKocjrMhJWd4VtELZvewNAQs)
(make a copy) for your reflection on your video, and make sure to include a
link to the video  at the top of this form. Relate your comments and
observations to the **Characteristics of effective feedback** at the bottom of
the form.  Include the completed form/reflection in your portfolio. 

## End of Quarter Reflection (document of any kind)

The final piece of your Portfolio is a reflection to be done at the end of the
quarter.   This should be done anytime during week 10, by Monday of finals
week.  More details about this reflection will be posted as the quarter draws
to a close.  

Optional: Any other observations, reflections or thoughts you have

Finally, you are always welcome to include any other thoughts, observations,
notes to yourself, etc in your portfolio.  This portfolio is for you to compile
what you know about effective teaching all in one place, so feel free to make
it your own!
