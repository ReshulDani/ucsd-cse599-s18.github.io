You will have a practicum assignment most weeks, which will involve preparing a
presentation, rubric, or other work outside of class to share with a group. The
topics and preparation will vary, and will be posted here as they are filled
assigned.

## Elevator Pitch (Practicum assignment, Due Week 2)

As a TA, you can serve as a role model and mentor for your students. They may
ask for your advice about their career, beyond the specific class you are
TAing. It's useful to think ahead to how you'd respond to some common
questions.

This week, you'll present a short reply to one of the following prompts:

How does the material in this class (choose the class you are currently TAing)
relate to what I'll do in my career after UCSD? [[ Because of the 1 minute time
limit, you'll need to pick a very specific example to speak about.]]

How did you know you wanted to be a Computer Scientist / software engineer?

What's your favorite fact in about Computer Science? What's a favorite
technological innovation?

How do you choose between graduate school and industry after graduation?

Your goal is to say something meaningful, correct, interesting, and useful
within the allotted time frame: one minute.

If you choose, you may use the white board during your presentation. Make sure
to rehearse and give yourself lots of time to prepare and polish your oral
presentation as well; 60 seconds go by very quickly if you don't plan them
carefully.

In the practicum session this week, each of your group members will present
their “elevator pitch”. If you have more time, try improvising answers to some
of the other questions. What are the characteristics of effective answers?
